# ALR Sim: Envs

Here we present some prepared Gym Environemnts.
They should serve as an example on how to implement your own environment.

At the moment we provide three Gym Environments:
- Reach: The robot endeffector should reach a goal position
- Pick & Place: The robot picks up a box and places it at its goal position
- Nut Assembly: The robot has to thread two nuts on their corresponding pegs.
